# Changelog

## Unreleased — 2026-09-14

### Added
- Scalar and fluent `value_kind`, `boolean_value`, and `text_value` primitives for original-domain classification and explicit Boolean/text projection, including heterogeneous object columns.
- Metadata-only, input-scoped compilation for type-sensitive expressions across standalone, relation, conform, and DAG execution. Schema-specialized native expressions must be recompiled for a different input representation.

### Changed
- Require Ibis 11.0.0 or newer.
- Honor explicit `LiteralNode.dtype` during native literal lowering, preserving typed nulls.
- Prepare capability operand-name indexes, operation/backend predicate buckets, and canonical reporting views once per registry publication instead of rediscovering them during scalar compilation.
- Capability registration and initial loading now publish whole batches atomically: a failure retains the previous data, and failed loads keep rethrowing the original exception. Registration rejects mutable payloads, unsupported dataclass subclasses, and noncanonical Enum value domains.
- Registry snapshots are opaque tokens. Recursive public mutations and first-load queries are rejected; each accessor reads one immutable generation, without compilation-wide transactions or cached input descriptors.

These primitives support consumer-owned normalization and whole-input validity checks; they do not implement Rules policy or change ternary semantics.
